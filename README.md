there is 2 folder
1) nodedemo : I use this folder as a backend 
	- we use nodejs and mongoose for store data in database and authenticate
2) vuedemo : I use this folder as a frontend
	- we can pass all data from here
	
for access this project node,npm and mongodb should install in pc.
 - first open nodedemo in terminal and install npm after than call "npm start" comand.
 - when nodeproject run it will automatic generate demo user
 - then keep this window as it is, and open vuedemo in another terminal tab,and call "npm run serve" after that you may login with test@test.com/Admin@123 username and password
